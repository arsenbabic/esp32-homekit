# esp32-homekit
Homekit integration on ESP32 based development board

**Requirements:**
- ESP32 based development board
- DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
- [Arduino IDE 1.8.x](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) library
- [Homekit-ESP32](https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP32) library


ESP32 development board I am currently using is [Joy-it Node MCU ESP32](https://joy-it.net/en/products/SBC-NodeMCU-ESP32). 

Data pin of the standard 5V WS2812B addressable LED strip is attached to pin 4 on the development board.  
Data pin of the DHT22 sensor I'm using is attached to digital pin 18 on the development board.
